# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Resnet50-on-Jetson-Nano 

## This Repository will guide you on how to work on Jetson Nano

# Step 1:
 
Download the Required Dataset mentioned in the Notebook Resnet50_Face_Mask_Detection.
I have used Resnet50 as Resnet50 can give an FPS close to 36 for Image Classification

# Step 2:

Use the Saved .h5 file to do further Inferencing.

# Step 3:

Follow the other 2 notebook on how to Optimize the .h5 to tensorflow saved Model and further to TensorRt to Inference on Jetson Nano

.h5 Model ---> TensorFlow Saved Model ---> TensorRT Model (For Inference On Jetson Nano)

You Can send the TensorFlow Saved Model file to Jetson Using SCP.
